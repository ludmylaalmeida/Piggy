# Piggy

Piggy is a social media for investors to connect through common interest groups, discuss investment opportunities and give financial advice. Users will be able to manage their stocks and cryptocurrency in one place. 

## Project Goal

The main goal is to create a web-based application where people can interact and create groups to talk about specific investments. Part of our goal is to make the application easy to use with a good user experience and user interface. 

## Project Organization 

Methodology

We will use the  Agile software development methodology to manage our project. To maximize the productivity a Scrum process will be adapted so the project manager can create and assign tickets. Have a backlog with possible future features and plan the sprint. Meetings will be held weekly to track the progress of each member.

## Project Setup

Piggy will be developed for the web using React as a front-end framework and Firebase as the database. The first step will be prototyping the app using Sketch to create high-fidelity wireframes. For the UI design standards, we will be using the Material UI guidelines provided by Google. The project will be managed using GitHub.



## Technologies

- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)

## Dev dependecies

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

_There will be other technologies later on, and we will add them later but this should get you started. Links are included above for you to easily navigate to these tehnologies._

## Project Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the latest version of [Node here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it yet.
3. After installing npm, from the terminal run `npm install -g gatsby-cli` (This will install the Gatsby CLI globally on your machine)
4. Go to the root folder of this repo and run `npm install`.
5. Start the server by running `npm start` or `gatsby develop`. This will start the local server with hot realoding enabled which will update the browser on code changes when saving.

You can also refer to this [Gatsby Part Zero Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/) <- This should help you to set up your environment fully, although the previous steps are just a simplified version of the steps on this tutorial!

After following the previous steps, navigate to http://localhost:8000 and you should be able to see a simple header, with a picture of some Hack.Alumni. This means that you have successfully started the server locally.

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool and more in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

There are more changes that will need to be added to this README.md once we start building more stuff in our platform but this is good for a start.


## Work Plan
<b>Roles in the group</b>

<h6>Project Manager: Ludmyla Almeida</h6>
The project manager will be responsible for creating and assigning tickets on GitHub, they will also be responsible for the project organization, weekly meetings on Discord, and helping team members to achieve their weekly goals.

<h6>Programmer: Nassika Dabel and Victoria Mom</h6>
The programmer will be responsible for developing the features, completing the tickets and participating in the meetings. If there is any impediment they must warn the project manager.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
