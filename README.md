Piggy is a social media for investors to connect through common interest groups, discuss investment opportunities and give financial advice. Users will be able to manage their stocks and cryptocurrency in one place. 

<h5>Project Goal</h5>
The main goal is to create a web-based application where people can interact and create groups to talk about specific investments. Part of our goal is to make the application easy to use with a good user experience and user interface. 

## Project Organization 
1.  **Methodology**
We will use the  Agile software development methodology to manage our project. To maximize productivity a Scrum process will be adapted so the project manager can create and assign tickets. Have a backlog with possible future features and plan the sprint. Meetings will be held weekly to track the progress of each member.
Project Setup
Piggy will be developed for the web using React as a front-end framework and Firebase as the database. The first step will be prototyping the app using Sketch to create high-fidelity wireframes. For the UI design standards, we will be using the Material UI guidelines provided by Google. The project will be managed using GitHub.
